                <h2>Youth Protection Training Policy Change Announced</h2>

                <p>As of June 1, 2010, Youth Protection Training is required for all registered volunteers
                    and must be retaken every two years. New leaders must complete YPT before their 
                    application is turned in. A letter covering all of the changes can be found
                    <a href="files/Youth_Protection_Training_Policies_June2010.pdf">here</a>.</p>
                
                <p>Classes are held in the Ford Center at Camp Miakonda</p>

                <h2>Fast Start Training</h2>

                <p>Fast Start Training for Cub Leaders, Boy Scout Leaders and Venture Crew Advisors is available 
                    at BSA's <a href="http://olc.scouting.org/">Online Learning Center</a>.
                
                <h2>Basic Adult Leader Outdoor Training (B.A.L.O.O.)</h2>

                <p>According to BSA guidelines, at least one adult on a Pack overnighter must have completed 
                    Basic Adult Leader Outdoor Orientation to properly understand the importance of program 
                    intent, youth protection guidelines, health and safety, site selection, age appropriate 
                    activities and sufficient adult participation.</p>

                <h2>Cub Leader Training</h2>

                <p>Why Become a Trained Leader?</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Boy Scouts of America National Office has mandated ALL ADULT Leaders must be trained 
                        in order to hold any leadership position.</li>
                    <li>Every scout deserves a leader who understands the program and knows how to deliver 
                        it with ENTHUSIASM and FUN!!</li>
                    <li>Research shows that scouts with trained leaders enjoy the program more and stay in longer!</li>
                </ol>
                 

                <h2>National Youth Leadership Training (NYLT)</h2>

                <p>Be part of the MOST advanced youth leadership course for Scouts! NYLT is a program that will 
                    help your Scouts develop both leadership skills and communication skills.</p>

                <h2>Wood Badge</h2>

                <p>Wood Badge is open to all Scout leaders. The course has been developed for Cub Scout, 
                    Boy Scout, Varsity Scout, Venture Scout, District, and Council leaders. The course 
                    focus is on developing leadership skills, not on out-of-door skills. All participants 
                    must have completed the Basic Leader Training Course for their position in Scouting. 
                    Outdoor Skills Training is not required but would be useful.</p>
